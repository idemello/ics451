OSI Model

    created in the late 80s

7 - Application - HTTP | DNS | SMTP
6 - Presentation formatting of information
5 - Session keeps track of sessions between client host or P2P
4 - Transport - keeps track if information reaches the right destination - TCP | UDP 
3 - Network - Responsible for the determining the path/routing - IP
2 - Data Link - Determines the access to the medium
1 - Physical - Responsible for actual signaling
0 - Medium

How is this useful today?
    Useful skill, when a concept is introduced
    try to put it into a layer of the OSI layer

Why do we use this
    Analogy:
    communication between President 1 <--> President 2
    Understanding how these two communicate
    Understanding the security (is the information received/sent correct?)
    How to deal with large amounts of data(orginization)
    Typically these sytems are symmetrical
    
Signal vs Data
    Data - Bits - discrete
    Signal - Sound waves and the like - Continous

Error checking happens at multiple layers
    Layers 2 , 4 , and 7 (happens the most often at these layers)


    All protocols will have a body, this is the information sent
    some will have headers as well
    Analogy Header = envelope body = letter

HTTP
    GET - when information is wanted, only a header sent
    POST -when information is sent, header and body sent
    HEAD -
    OPTIONS - 

URL - Universal Resource Locator
    consists of http://www.hawaii.edu/ics/451/hw1
    4 pieces of information when a url is put into the bar
    path - the resource at that location ex:  /ics/451/hw1
    host - www.hawaii.edu

A browser is an HTTP client

Ports
    A server has many "doors" or ports where each number refers to different things
    Ex. HTTP is port 80
    If the wrong type of information is sent ex. DNS on port 80. will probably send back an error
    

The user agent is a description of the http client, browser, OS, etc.
